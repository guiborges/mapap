Partnership Mapping in Protected Areas
MAPAP (Partnership Mapping in Protected Areas) is the result of a research effort into the landscape of partnerships within Brazil's protected areas. The project covers all administrative levels (federal, state, and municipal) and considers a wide variety of partnership models. This information is often scattered across various sources, presented with varying levels of detail, or is simply unavailable. As such, MAPAP is a survey that is constantly being updated and refined. It aims to function as a collaborative platform, built upon research and dialogue with public and private institutions.
